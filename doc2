68	
69	CONFIGURING NET CONNECTION
70	===========================
71	The LiveCD attempts to detect the network cards present in the system.
72	On each detected network card, dhcpcd is automatically started in the
73	background. If it is not correct to acquire the network settings via DHCP
74	in your location, or if you want to use dialup or GPRS connection, run the
75	"net-setup" command.
76	
77	CONFIGURING X
78	===========================
79	The LiveCD attempts to configure X for your video card automatically. The
80	process may fail if you have more than one video card, if your video card
81	doesn't support 24-bit color depth, or if your monitor is not Plug-n-Play
82	compatible (in other words, doesn't tell its characteristics to Xorg via DDC).
83	Also, in the following cases, the autodetection process is known to suggest
84	a non-working driver even for 2D graphics:
85	
86	    * ATI Radeon X1000 or higher (needs "vesa" or proprietary "fglrx" driver)
87	    * Any NVIDIA card with the monitor connected to the DVI output (needs
88	      "vesa" or proprietary "nvidia" driver).
89	
90	In such cases, you have to edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file manually, using
91	vim, joe or nano.
92	
93	1) In Section "Device", specify the driver for your video card, e.g.:
94	
95	Section "Device"
96	        Identifier      "Generic Video Card"
97	        Driver          "ati"
98	EndSection
99	
100	Installers of proprietary video drivers are available in /unios-sources as *.run
101	files. IMPORTANT: in order to avoid wasting RAM by the device mapper,
102	change the current directory to /dev/shm before installing these drivers.
103	
104	2) In Section "Monitor", specify the allowed frequency ranges for your
105	monitor. If unsure, consult the manual that came with your monitor. If
106	such information is not there, but you know a working resolution and refresh
107	rate, run the "gtf" command. E.g., if your monitor can handle 1280x1024@85Hz:
108	
109	$ gtf 1280 1024 85
110	
111	Note: you must specify the refresh rate of 60 Hz for LCD monitors.
112	
113	Then look at the output:
114	
115	# 1280x1024 @ 85.00 Hz (GTF) hsync: 91.38 kHz; pclk: 159.36 MHz
116	Modeline "1280x1024_85.00"  159.36  1280 1376 1512 1744  1024 1025 1028 1075 -HSync +Vsync
117	
118	Put the synchronization ranges that contain the printed values. For the above
119	example, this means that the following information should be added in the
120	"Monitor" section:
121	
122	Section "Monitor"
123	        Identifier      "Generic Monitor"
124	        Option          "DPMS"
125	        HorizSync       30-92   # because gtf said "hsync: 91.38 kHz"
126	        VertRefresh     56-86   # because a 85 Hz mode has been requested
127	        # the Modeline may also be pasted here
128	EndSection
129	
130	3) In the Section "Screen", change the DefaultDepth and add the "Modes"
131	line to SubSection "Display" with the proper color depth. If you added custom
132	Modelines, you have to specify them exactly as defined, i.e. "1280x1024_85.00"
133	in the example above. The built-in Modelines have names similar to "1024x768",
134	without explicit specification of the refresh rate.
135	
136	When you are finished editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf, run startx.
137	
138	CUSTOMIZING THE CD CONTENTS
139	===========================
140	It is possible to burn a customized version of the official Linux From
141	Scratch LiveCD, with your own files added. To do that, follow the
142	instructions below.
143	
144	* Burn the official CD in multi session mode:
145	    cdrecord dev=/dev/cdrom -v -multi -tao unioslivecd-[version].iso
146	
147	* Prepare a directory with the files you want to add, delete or change:
148	    mkdir second-session && cd second-session
149	    vim path/to/new-file
150	    vim path/to/file-to-be-changed
151	    echo path/to/file1-to-be-deleted >.delete
152	    echo path/to/file2-to-be-deleted >>.delete
153	    cd ..
154	
155	* Make an image contatining those files:
156	    mkisofs -l -M unioslivecd-[version].iso \
157	        -C `cdrecord -msinfo dev=/dev/cdrom` \
158	        -R -o second-session.iso second-session
159	
160	* Append the image you just created to the official UNIOS
161	  LiveCD:
162	    cdrecord dev=/dev/cdrom -v -multi -tao second-session.iso
163	
164	
165	AUTOSSHD
166	============================
167	It is possible to start the sshd daemon automatically upon boot. To do that,
168	you have to customize the CD as described above. Add the following files:
169	
170	* /.autosshd
171	    This is the file that indicates that the sshd daemon should be
172	    started automatically. It should be empty.
173	
174	* /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
175	    Add your public key to that file in order to be able to log in.
176	    Alternatively, modify /etc/shadow.
177	
178	* /etc/shadow
179	    Edit this file if you want to allow root to login using a password via
180	    ssh. It is more secure to use public key based authentication instead.
181	
182	* /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key, /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
183	    Create those files as described in the ssh-keygen(1) manual page. If you
184	    don't do that, random host keys will be generated for you automatically
185	    during the boot process. This is less secure, because you can't verify
186	    them.
187	
188	* /etc/sysconfig/network-devices/ifconfig.eth0
189	    Configure a known static IP address there, as described in the unios book,
190	    section "7.12. Configuring the network Script".
191	
192	* /etc/udev/rules.d/50-network.rules
193	    Create an empty file in order to prevent udev from running dhcpcd.
194	
195	INTERNATIONALIZATION
196	============================
197	It is possible to specify the locale using the bootloader prompt, like this:
198	
199	  linux LANG=es_ES@euro
200	
201	The CD tries to guess the proper screen font and keymap based on this
202	information. If the guess is wrong, you can override it by adding the
203	following parameters:
204	
205	  KEYMAP: specifies the console keymap(s) to load (actually the arguments to
206	  the "loadkeys" program separated by the "+" sign), e.g: KEYMAP=es+euro1
207	
208	  LEGACY_CHARSET: sometimes a ready-made UTF-8 keymap is not available and
209	  must be obtained by converting an existing keymap from this charset to UTF-8.
210	  E.g.: LEGACY_CHARSET=iso-8859-15
211	  This parameter is not used in non-UTF-8 locales.
212	
213	  FONT: specifies the screen font to set (actually, the arguments to the
214	  "setfont" program separated by the "+" sign), e.g:
215	  FONT=LatArCyrHeb-16+-m+8859-15
216	
217	  XKEYMAP: the keymap to use with X window system, e.g. XKEYMAP=us
218	
219	Alternatively, these items can be configured interactively using dialog-based
220	interface if the locale is not specified on the boot prompt.
221	
222	For some locales (e.g. lv_LV.ISO-8859-13) there is no valid console keymap,
223	but there is a keymap for X. In this case, the only solution is to use X.
224	
225	While this CD configures the LANG environment variable, console font and
226	keymap for you, it's your responsibility to configure other locale-dependent
227	parameters manually. You may want to configure character sets for SAMBA in
228	/etc/samba/smb.conf, and to explicitly specify the "iocharset" and "codepage"
229	options when mounting filesystems with Windows origin (e.g., vfat and isofs).
230	
231	The CD contains TrueType fonts that cover the orthography of most of European
232	and some Asian languages. No additional configuration is required in order to
233	use these fonts.
234	
235	Use of this LiveCD with Chinese, Japanese or Korean language requires that
236	your monitor has at least 80 pixels per inch in order for hieroglyphs to
237	be recognizable (i.e., at least 12 pixels high). This means the following
238	minimum resolution:
239	
240	    15" => 1024x768
241	    17" => 1024x768
242	    19" => 1280x1024
243	    20" => 1280x1024
244	
245	If your monitor cannot handle such resolution, edit the
246	/etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc file with vim, nano or joe, and add the -dpi 94
247	parameter to the X server command line there.
248	
249	BRAILLE DISPLAY SUPPORT
250	===========================
251	The LiveCD includes the "brltty" program that allows a blind person to read
252	the contents of Linux text console on a Braille display. In order to
253	activate it:
254	
255	* Insert the CD into the drive, reboot the computer. The BIOS will produce
256	  a beep, indicating successful power-on self-testing. Then it will load
257	  the boot loader from the CD, and the boot loader will produce a second beep.
258	* After the second beep, type:
259	
260	linux brltty=eu,ttyS0
261	
262	  This example assumes that the EuroBraille device is connected to the
263	  first serial port. For other device types, the brltty parameter will
264	  be different.
265	
266	Note: in some locales, brltty displays incorrect Braille patterns. This is
267	related to the fact that Braille tables in brltty are indexed with
268	encoding-dependent byte representing the character. Such representation
269	becomes invalid when another encoding for the same language is used.
270	E.g., that's why the "ru" table (designed for KOI8-R encoding) produces
271	wrong result in the ru_RU.CP1251 locale.
272	
273	Known non-working cases:
274	    All CP1251-based locales (no CP1251 Braille table in brltty)
275	    zh_TW (configuration instructions available in Chinese only)
276	    All other Chinese, Japanese and Korean locales (no support in brltty)
277	
278	If brltty displays incorrect Braille patterns displays incorrect Braille
279	patterns in your locale, please revert to the en_US locale, thus avoiding
280	the use of non-ASCII characters. If you know how to fix this problem
281	for your locale, mail this information to livecd@linuxfromscratch.org.
282	
283	RESUMING THE BUILD
284	===========================
285	There is a hint "How to resume your work after a break at different
286	unios stages" available at:
287	
288	http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/stages-stop-and-resume.txt
289	
290	Instructions from there should work on this CD, however, there is a simpler
291	(but highly experimental) method described below.
292	
293	1) Make sure you have (or are planning to create) a swap partition not used
294	   by other Linux systems installed on your hard drive. The text below assumes
295	   that /dev/hda2 is your (existing or planned) swap partition.
296	
297	2) Pass "resume=/dev/hda2" as one of the kernel arguments when booting this CD.
298	   I.e., the complete boot line may look as:
299	   linux LANG=ru_RU.UTF-8 TZ=Asia/Yekaterinburg resume=/dev/hda2
300	
301	3) In chapter 2, the book tells you to create (if you didn't do it already),
302	   format that partition with mkswap, and activate it with swapon. Follow the
303	   instructions in the book.
304	
305	4) If you use X window system, take the following into account:
306	   * Users of old S3 video cards should uncomment the "EnableVbetool" line
307	     in the /etc/hibernate/common.conf file.
308	   * Hibernation is incompatible with the proprietary "nvidia" driver.
309	
310	5) Follow the book as your time permits.
311	
312	6) When your time runs out, execute the "hibernate" command as root. It is not
313	   necessary to stop the compilation, but running this command during a
314	   testsuite may lead to failures that would not occur otherwise.
315	
316	NOTE: you must unmount all USB flash drives and all partitions used by other
317	operating systems installed on your computer before hibernating! Don't
318	attempt to mount partitions used by a hibernated system from other systems
319	(even read-only, because there is no true read-only mount on journaled
320	filesystems)!
321	
322	7) The computer will save its state to your swap partition and power down.
323	   This CD will remain in the drive.
324	
325	8) When you are ready to resume the build, boot this CD again and pass exactly
326	   the same "vga=..." and "resume=..." arguments that you used earlier.
327	
328	9) The computer will load its state from the swap partition and behave as if
329	   you didn't power it off at all (except breaking all network connections).
330	   The build will automatically continue.
331	
332	The procedure is a bit more complicated if your swap is on a LVM volume
333	or on software RAID. In this case, instead of passing the resume=... argument,
334	you should boot the CD as usual and make actions needed for the kernel to see
335	the swap device (for LVM, that's "vgchange -ay"). After doing that, note
336	the major and minor device number for that device (assigning persistent numbers
337	is highly recommended), and echo them to /sys/power/resume. E.g., for LVM:
338	
339	# ls -lL /dev/myvg/swap
340	brw------- 1 root root 254, 3 2006-07-10 17:51 /dev/myvg/swap
341	# echo 254:3 >/sys/power/resume
342	
343	In the case of the first boot, this will print an error, but store the device
344	numbers to be used for hibernation. Ignore the error and hibernate when needed.
345	
346	On the second boot (i.e., after hibernating), this "echo" command will restore
347	the computer state from the swap device.
348	
349	THANKS
350	===========================
351	Many thanks to all whose suggestions, support and hard work have helped create
352	this CD.
